YOURLS Import Export
====================

YOURLS Import Export is a plugin for [YOURLS](http://yourls.org/) that helps you import and export your YOURLS URLs.

Import/Export code has been heavily borrowed from the [Redirection](http://urbangiraffe.com/plugins/redirection/) plugin for WordPress by John Godley.

Supported things at the moment:

 1. CSV - Import & Export (source, destination, hits).
